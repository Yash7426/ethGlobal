**Humanized** is a cross-chain identity verification platform that consolidates multiple blockchain addresses into a single, verifiable identity, ensuring fair participation in blockchain airdrops.

## How Humanized Works
- **Unified Identity**: Users create DNS-like domain names linking all their blockchain addresses under one human-centered identity.
- **Task-Based Verification**: Users earn points by completing tasks, distinguishing real users from bots.
- **Fair Airdrops**: Tokens are distributed based on the user’s domain, preventing multiple claims from different addresses.
- **Enhanced Security**: Advanced cryptography ensures each identity’s authenticity, protecting against duplicate claims.

## Key Protocols
- **Sign Protocol**: Verifies users with tasks (e.g., CAPTCHAs), reinforced by decentralized social validation.
- **Reclaim Protocol**: Integrates off-chain data (e.g., Uber, Amazon) for stronger identity verification while preserving privacy.
- **Lit Protocol**: Secures data with Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and encrypted cross-chain interactions.
- **CCIP Protocol**: Links blockchain addresses under a single domain name, supporting Solana, Ethereum, Dase, DNB, and Flow for cross-chain interoperability.

## Bridging Web2 and Web3
Humanized merges on-chain and off-chain data with encrypted identity management, creating secure, user-friendly interactions across blockchain ecosystems.

## Key Features
- **Privacy & Control**: Ensures privacy with encrypted data.
- **Real-World Connections**: Uses off-chain activities to enhance decentralized identities.
- **Robust Verification**: Combines human and social validation to prevent fraud.
- **Unified Identity**: Simplifies cross-chain interactions using a user-defined domain.

## Vision and Impact
Humanized fights Sybil attacks through decentralized identity verification, offering security, seamless cross-chain interoperability, and a user-friendly experience. Our vision is to set a new standard for secure and privacy-respecting decentralized networks in the Web3 era.
